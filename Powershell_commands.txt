                                   # BASICS OF WINDOWS POWER SHELL

Windows powershell is basically a Windows command -line shell which is
especially designed  for system administrator.

Windows powershell introduces the concept of cmdlet a simple, single function
command line-tool built into the shell

It allows us access to the file system of computer.

It supports aliases to refers command by alternative name. Aliasing allows
user with experience in other shells to use common commands that they already
known for similar operation in powershell

Powershell can be directly opened by searching powershell in search bar
                        or
it can be run ie. pressing win+r and then by writing powershell 

                                  # THE CONCEPT OF PATH

A path is unique location of a file or a folder in a file system of an OS.
A path consist of / and alpha -numeric character.

There are two types of path.

 1. Absolute path
An Absolute path is defined as a compiler path from start of actual file
system from / directory

To write an absolute path name
1. start a root directory and work down
2. Write slash(/ )  after every directory name(last one is optional)

EX.	To specify the path of Hello.txt, We started from the root directory
ie. C: and then to USER/Admin/Documents/Hello.txt/


cat C:/User/Admin/Documents/hello.txt

2. Relatiive path
A  Relative path is defined as a compiler path from present working directory
to working file.

Relative path name uses 
-> .(a single dot) this represents the current directory
-> ..(two dots) this represents the parent directory.
Ex.	Now, we are presently working in Documnents directory and we have to
	access ABC.csv 
	Instead of specifying full absolute path from C: directory we can just
	give the relative path to change parent directory.
	cd ../Downloads
	cat ABC.csv

                                        # FILE SYSTEM
